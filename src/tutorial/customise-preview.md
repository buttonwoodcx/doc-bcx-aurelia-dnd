# Customise preview

There are two situations you want to use customise preview.

1. when the built-in preview drawer doesn't draw preview to your expectation, either due to css limitation or DOM hierarchy limitation.
2. when you want a totally different preview, for instance, customise "cursor" during DnD session.

DnD source `delegate` has an optional callback `dndPreview(model)` to draw customised preview. The input is the model generated by `dndModel()`, the output needs to be a DOM element (not attached to DOM tree yet).

In this tutorial, we use jQuery (not required) to create DOM element.
